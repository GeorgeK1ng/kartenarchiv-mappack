Map Maker:	David Wells and Tang Wen En
E-Mail Address:	cattleman@h3trio.com    fieryphoenix@pacific.net.sg

Map Type:	Singleplayer  1 Human 7 Computers (not literally =)
Language:	Swahili.... kidding English

Description:	It is the night before you are to be wed ... But little do you know that the Lords of Order and the Lords of Chaos have struck a bargain ... And your lives are at stake .....

Special Win:	Transport Artifact
Special Loss:	NONE (refer to Special Other)
Special Other:	Even if is not stated technically (but you *should* be able to imply it), if you lose any of your heroes, you CANNOT finish the map. 
                SAVE your game frequently, this is 'one of those' maps =) We will NOT be responsible for shrieks of despair, cries of agony and suicide.

Narrative:	play on EXPERT, or else the delicate balance of this map will be 'screwed'. Read EVERY text you come across and follow ALL directions, inane as they may sometimes seem. For if you don't, your health will seriously be in jeopardy... 

If you encounter a "week of the (monster)" and they pop up on the map, please reload the latest autosave and keep trying till you get a non monster popping week. (eg week of the badger) some parts will be unplayable if this practise is not observed. 

Narrative (contd): The 'extra' bonuses you get in the end are not required to win, if you want to fight Lord Chaos without the extra behemoths or Titans for a bigger challenge, go ahead.

Spoilers below:

Adelaide: 
- To outrun the blue guy chasing you, do NOT recruit boars from the first glen you come across. When the next turn comes around, you can recruit from the second (ignore the third) boar glen. Recruit Sharpshooters and go through the subteranean gate, down the other and WAIT in front of the red border guard. Next turn, go through and RUN for the castle north-east of the border guard. 2 enemies will attack you here, you should be able to defeat them.

- Don't forget to visit the Glade of Air!

- To outrun the deathknight, Be'em, dimiss all troops whose speed is below 8. wait in front of the red border guard. Next turn, defeat Chaos Minion, retrieve the orgre club of havoc, and follow the path. At the warning, quickly turn back and find the secret passage through the mountains. Visit the seer. Get Boots of Levitation, wait for fill movement again, and RUN over the small patch of water and into the subterrenean gate.

- DO NOt visit the swan lakes.

- Choose the upper ship (if you didn't you are silly =) and visit the swan lake.

- Enemy shouldn't be able to catch up. Right at the end he should be one step behind you and you one step from disembarking the boat. (This, I must say, or brag, or boast=), took hours of calculation and practical tests to perfect =) 

- For the waterwalk chase, Do NOT visit the little 'landing zones'. Stay in the water with the spirits for the remainder of the turns. 

- To block the passage to the 'forest fire' area, use the Tome of Water Magic you found to summon a boat at the entrance.

- When instructed to bathe, bathe. =)

- It would be a good idea to acquire archangels and dismiss everything else.

- For the last run, run into the tiny 'alcove' behind the subterranean gate on the central isle, the enemy should die just before reaching you.

- There is one more secret passage...


Edric:
- Do NOt forget to get the sharpshooters to the left of the seers hut.

- Try not to lose a single sharpshooter.

- Secret passage: visit the treetop towers before proceeding.

- Visit the three shrines.

- To defeat Kilgor, you will first have to purchase an ammo cart. Next, simply teleport your nomads during your catapults turn, or fly your griffons, directly in front of the drawbridge. The ABs won't be able to get out, as long as you skip the catapult's turns or course. Then just shoot with impunity.

- To take over the water conflux, recruit water elementals and teleport them to block the Ice elementals. Fly your griffons forward. Shoot Ice elementals. Your water elementals perish. Next turn, block Ice elementals with griffons and cast slow. Shoot Ice elementals. Griffons *should* perish by Ice elementals. But by that time you will have sufficient firepower to finish them off. 

- Do not forget to visit the Blue Keymaster's Tent south of the Stronghold Castle.

- To take over Tower Castle, teleport Ice elementals right outside the drawbridge. Titans attack your sharpshooters. Shoot Titans with Ice elementals and sharpshooters. After killing them, work on the other creatures. Do NOT use your catapult even if it is very tempting to try and knock down the turrets. You may open a hole for the Nagas to slither through.

- Visit Hut of the Magi so Adelaide can continue on her journey.

- The Enchanters southwest of the first Rampart Castle will join you.

- Do not forget to take the Pandora's Box in the Land of the Behemoths or visit the spring.

- Crag Hack is unbeatable, do not attempt staying around to try your luck.

- Take the Orbs of Negation and Silt at their respective glades.

- Follow the instructions on the sign on the path to Lord Chaos. 

- The Ancient Behemoths will join you.



That's all. It should be sufficient. If not, email ME, Fiery Phoenix, for help, 'cause i'm more user friendly. =) kidding. Please give both of us comments upon completion or death. We would like to hear your opinion on the greatest map ever made =) Of course, if it is orthogonal to our view, we'll dismiss your opinion as the ramblings of a crazy misfit =) Honestly, however, we are quite sick of this map, been testing it like CRAZY. Now, PLAY THE MAP!
