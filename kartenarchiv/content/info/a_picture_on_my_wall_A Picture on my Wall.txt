Additional info (no spoilers):
This is an old school map, where you start from humble beginnings. With no fort to begin with, choosing 200% will give a very slow start, 160% can already make for a fairly smooth start with some luck. The developing and choice of your starting heroes is in your own hands. Castles, heroes, artefacts and resources have mostly been set to random.
Some spells have been disabled or made extremely rare: Fly, Dimension Door and Town Portal.
