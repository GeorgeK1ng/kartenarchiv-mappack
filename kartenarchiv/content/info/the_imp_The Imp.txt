HINTS/TIPS *SPOILERS*

1. Defeating the manticores: Use your eyes... is there a place on the map where not so many stacks can attack at once? (I've a specific place in mind (not a corner). If you go to this place, it will be a 'two-front' battle instead of three.) Cure is your best friend in this battle. Hypnotize is good too, if you can find it... isn't necessary though.

2. Defeating Velune: No specifics here (not really ;-P). DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE THE ORB OF INHIBITION!!! He gets to perform 1-2 resurrections. Take out the scorpicores and minotaurs first. (don't worry about the medusae, they'll run out of shots very fast.) The Archmage serves as a distraction and a spell cost reducing thingie. 

3. Use your eyes and cursor to get at the Pandora's Boxes. EVERY ONE of them is accessable. 

4. Water Magic is very useful...

5. If you can't find the 'hidden' spells, looking in the thumbnail map can show you where the paths are.  

6. Last battle: Resurrection is nice here. of course, finding it is a problem though... Hypnotized devils do nice damage.
