\par Map Title:  \tab When Champions Fail
\par Map Author:  \tab Fizbin the Magniloquent  (Chris Tiahrt)
\par E-mail:  \tab \tab chrisat@brescia.edu
\par Game Version:  \tab HOMM III, Shadow of Death
\par Size:  \tab \tab small, one level
\par Difficulty:  \tab hard
\par Positions:  \tab one human (random), one computer (castle)
\par Special Victory:\tab defeat creatures
\par \pard\li1440\fi-1440\plain\f2\fs20 Special Loss:\tab Formally standard, but consider loss of your starting hero as loss (I did not want to force you to endure the executioner scene repeatedly on a reload heavy map). \tab 
\par \pard\plain\f2\fs20 Playing Time:  \tab estimated at 3 hours (about 3 months game time)
\par Play-testers:\tab Netbrian (Netbrian@aol.com)
\par \tab \tab Gaidal Cain (gaidal.cain@user.bip.net)
\par \tab \tab Serge (sergeipoo@yahoo.com)
\par \tab \tab Victor Coyot Urban (coyot@pinknet.cz)
\par \tab \tab The Pacifist (victor-angel.bolzoni@cfwb.be)
\par \pard\li1440\fi-1440\plain\f2\fs20 Description: \tab The cavaliers of the kingdom are dead.  All of them.  Slain by the marauding dragon known as Firefang.  And when champions fail, peasants must be heroes.
\par Spells Prohibited:  fly, dimension door, summoning spells, magic arrow, "junk" spells (e.g. animate dead) unless given as a hero's starting spell.  Note: only haste and magic arrow are denied the AI.
\par Skills Allowed:\tab air magic, armorer, artillery, earth magic, fire magic, leadership, learning, logistics, luck, offense, path finding, resistance, scholar, sorcery, tactics, water magic, wisdom, and any hero starting skills except necromancy.
\par Artifacts:\tab All artifacts except Hourglass of the Evil Hour are banned from random occurance.  Placed artifacts include components of the wizard's well, admiral's hat, titan's thunder, power of the dragon father, armor of the damned, elixir of life, angelic alliance, as well as the individual artifacts: greater gnoll's flail, sword of hellfire, hellstorm helmet, breastplate of brimstone, spyglass, angel wings, orb of the firmament, orb of silt, orb of tempestuous fire, orb of driving rain, recanter's cloak, spirit of oppression, boots of levitation, golden bow, orb of vulnerability, necklace of swiftness, cape of velocity, pendant of negativity, endless bag of gold, shackles of war, orb of inhibition, vial of dragon blood, armageddon's blade.
\par Heroes Allowed: \tab all except Mutare Drake
\par Heroes Modified:\tab All with necromancy skill have necromancy replaced with equivalent levels of earth magic.  All with direct damage spells (e.g. magic arrow) have starting spell replaced by slow.  None begin with spell books.
\par Notes:\tab 1.  The entire map is completed with only one peasant!  Expect to need reloads -- protecting the peasant can be tricky.
\par \tab 2.  Even though all stacks are pre-set, the map plays very differently with different heroes/skills.
\par \tab 3.  There is no difference between hard, expert, and impossible difficulty settings.
\par \tab 4.  Before entering the swamp, save your game.
\par \tab 5.  Monster stacks randomly generated by month of the _ events may cause problems.  I would really not worry much about, for instance, month of the goblin -- no area can be blocked by less than two stacks.  But month of the Efreet Sultan (or some other creature you can't defeat)  should probably cause you to reload your autosave and try again.

\par \pard\li720\fi-720\plain\f2\fs20 Strategies (minor spoilers):
\par 
\par 1.  Artillery and earth magic are invaluable -- top priority.
\par 2.  Scholar is also very helpful.  Bernito can share great spells -- after he gets a magic book.  Water magic and either pathfinding or logistics can help substantially in certain situations..
\par 3.  It is possible to win with almost any combination of skills, and different skills significantly change many battles.  Some incredibly bad combinations of skills in the main hero may require one to use Bernito in a couple of situations -- but you would really have to try to get skills that bad.
\par 4.  Magic heroes have an easier time than might heroes -- you didn't really think a peasant could kill a dragon bare-handed?
\par 5.  Follow the order of conquest suggested by events, but you need not clear everything when it's first encountered.  However; I am aware of no items that cannot be claimed when they are first encountered -- regardless of your hero's skills.
\par 6.  Purchase war machines! 
\par 7.  Generally, but not always, equiping the ring of the wayfarer makes battles easier than forming the elixir of life.  Assemble and deassemble the elixir as needed.
\par 
\par 
\par Tactics (major spoilers):
\par 
\par 1.  Hit and run.  Use haste, slow, or even teleport to allow the peasant to evade enemy troops while spells and the ballista do the actual killing.
\par 2.  Exchange artifacts to suit the circumstance, and watch what you have equipped -- especially scrolls and speed enhancers.
\par 3.  Decoy.  Use the peasant to lure dangerous troops away from stationary war machines -- but be sure to stay out of range.  Also use your peasant to entice the AI to group creatures for an area spell.
\par 4.  Count hit points.  With artifacts, the peasant can absorb some slight damage.  Take a small hit now to avoid a big one later, and delay attacks if enemy turns after a retaliation will kill you.
\par 5.  Recognize what time allows.  Mass slow will not save you from shooters, and chain lightning is useless if a fast stack survives to strike next turn.  Sometimes your best spell is not the obvious.
\par 6.  Seek artifacts to enhance your number of offensive actions -- I like armegeddon's blade (allows simultaneous attack of all enemies) and armor of the damned (saves need to cast slow).
\par 7.  Note Firefang is on cursed ground, but remember that SoD allows 1st level spells on cursed ground.
\par 8.  What your main hero cannot do may be possible with Bernito.
\par 
\par 
\par Getting started (a playthrough of early battles in the order they should occur).
\par USE ONLY IF STUMPED
\par 
\par 1.  Fighting two peasants.  You must get the AI to split its forces on either side of the long rift.  I move directly to the base of that rift and stay there until at least one opponent is committed -- then I move to the other side.  Use wait and defend to avoid ever coming within three hexes of an opponent (use combat options to disply a hex grid if it helps).  For safety's sake, you should have picked up the spirit of oppression before this battle.  It is one artifact I never unequip; untimely enemy morale boosts can be fatal.
\par 2.  Fighting the gremlin.  First you need the ring of vitality and the vial of life blood.  Do not attempt this battle without them.  (They are accessible after defeating the peasants.)  Essentially the secret is knowing when to attack.  I defend until the enemy has one hit point left, then I attack.  (The idea is to avoid taking damage from a retaliation, followed by fatal damage from an attack.)
\par 3.  Attacking the pikeman.  Acquire the land mine scroll, and visit the two star axes.  Be sure you have built a mage guild and purchased a spell book.  Cast land mine, and use your peasant to lure the pikeman over a mine.  You can afford to take a hit or two, but it's not necessary here.
\par 4 (or 5).  Fighting the boars.  Same idea as fighting pikeman, but it's harder to avoid taking hits.
\par 5 (or 4).  Fighting the imp.  Same idea as fighting the gremlin.  Just be aware that the imp is faster than you.
\par 6.  Fighting the rogues.  The enemies are too many and too fast to rely on slow (or landmine) and the balista.  Pick up the anit-magic scroll first, and equip it with death ripple.  First round, anti-magic your peasant, staying out of range of the rogues.  Second round, death ripple.
\par 
\par 
\par Getting through the antimagic garrison.
\par USE ONLY IF STUMPED
\par 
\par Note that neither stack of shooters can inflict enough damage to kill you by itself.  Adjust your peasant's speed to that of the orcs (4), and equip the elixir of life.  The wolves will move, the orc chieftains will shoot, you'll heal (move to evade wolves), orcs will shoot, ballista kills something, first aid tent heals -- now it's easy.  If you are playing Sir Mullich, you may have to use Bernito here.
\par 
\par 
\par Defeating Magogs and Peasants without water magic or armorer skills
\par USE ONLY IF STUMPED
\par 
\par Note that magogs will avoid friendly fire -- and you can stand a half strength attack from one stack.  So teleport your peasant directly in front of a stack of size 7.  Other magogs will target your war machines!  Two dangers remain: the peasants and your own ballista (which, if you don't have the artillery skill, will tend to target the magogs "protecting" your peasant).  I'll let you figure out how to handle those dangers.  Alternative: return later with Armegeddon's blade equipped.
\par 
\par 
\par Defeating "Pony Express"
\par USE ONLY IF STUMPED
\par 
\par Method 1:  If you have expert earth magic, equip all speed artifacts.  Champions will wait, then mass slow makes this easy.
\par Method 2:  Use fire wall or forcefield to protect your peasant.  If neither of these is at expert level, you may need to move to the corner by the ammo cart -- then a two hex spell will still protect you.  Note that these spells expire at the beginning of the second round after they are cast -- you need to cast them in layers (which works against the two hex creatures you fight) unless you can ensure getting the first move of a given round.  If your main hero has none of: earth magic, fire magic, tactics, artillery, you may need to use Bernito here -- he does have adequate skills.
\par 
\par 
\par Defeating the Magic Elementals
\par USE ONLY IF STUMPED
\par 
\par You must protect your peasant from a second round hit.  Either expert haste or prayer ensures you will have the first move of the second round.  In the absence of this, you must rely upon forcefield to shelter your peasant, then teleport second round, after waiting to see where a safe hex will be.  Again, note that Bernito has a combination of skills that makes this work if your main hero does not. 
\par 
\par 
\par Getting the Orb of Vulnerability (if you have neither pathfinding nor logistics)
\par USE ONLY IF STUMPED
\par 
\par The general idea is to use Bernito as a decoy to lure the red hero out of the way while your main hero dashes toward the orb.  But I've found the AI reacts to Bernito differently in different plays.  As far as I know, the AI always chases your main hero.
\par 1.  Set up.
\par \tab a.  Use boots of levitation to cross into swamp, summon boat, equip admiral's hat, board boat and leave shore.
\par \tab b.  Dock boat on wilderness side of river.
\par \tab c.  Have Bernito board boat.  Maneuver main hero to crossing point (on wilderness side).  End turn.
\par \tab d.  Main hero levitates across river, waits on swamp shore.  Bernito moves boat adjacent to main hero.  Main hero hands boots of levitation to Bernito.  Bernito lands ship in wilderness.  Main hero moves toward sanctuary, staying out of range of hero in red castle (I go to edge of swamp grass that stretches to sanctuary.
\par \tab e.  Red hero rushes towards main hero; main hero moves into sanctuary.   Bernito equips boots of levitation and prepares to cross river.
\par \tab f.  Red hero retreats back toward red castle.  Bernito crosses the river.
\par 2A.\tab If red hero rushes toward Bernito.  Bernito re-crosses the river.  Main hero rushes toward orb of vulnerability.  Red hero will chase, but cannot catch up.
\par 2B.\tab If red hero stays in castle, you must determine whether the AI will chase Bernito if close, or ignore Bernito entirely.
\par \tab a.  Move main hero near Bernito (but out of reach of red hero).  When red hero rushes toward main hero, move main hero back to sanctuary; leave Bernito alone.  
\par \tab b.  If red hero kills Bernito, that should give main hero enough room to rush toward the orb.
\par \tab c.  If red hero ignores Bernito, use Bernito to get the orb!
\par Alternatives (slower and/or riskier):
\par 1.  Use try to get logistics and/or pathfinding for Bernito.  Use trees of knowledge to build him up, trading for gems if needed.
\par 2.  With Armageddon's blade equipped, you might be able to defeat the red hero -- just hope he has no direct damage spells!
