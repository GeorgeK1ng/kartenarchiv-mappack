WoG Notes: This Map contains no scripts. It`s like an optimized Random Map. Take your favorite wogify 
settings and start :-) The map is much harder than random maps. You may give yourself a few advantages.

Special map for very long playing. Tons of stuff to explore. Take your time to end this map.


Story:

When your father died he shared all his own into three pieces. One for each of his sons. The north west
and the south east provinces for your two brothers. They should protect you from the evil neighbours. You 
got the smallest province in the center of the country. But your brothers are fool cowards. They sold 
their "Erbe" to the Heterics and Rangers. Left country and where not seen for month now. 

A special agent of your father just reached you breathless: "Since your brothers took the best armies for 
their own protection. The left weak armies and all citizens flew from towns, a few days ago. But that not
all bad news. I heared about, that the Necromancers and Wizards broke the peace alliance.

I suppose they are frightened about a new force, upcoming from the underground. Wizards report that they can
feel it`s force growing. We are lost, Master. We must flea and save our life!" You are left alone!
