facts and tips:

-no eagle eye
-no level 5 mage guild
-some spells only available at books, scrolls or quests
-some prisons are only for the computer (in the teleport system, warnings appear),
   these heroes are strong, have specials and are renamed
-most artifacts/cities/monsters are random 
-most monsters grow
-buy level 8 creatures first in dwellings, than in towns
-you can use bank,transfer all and buy all buttons in the city window

-all inferno heroes (apart from 5 red starting heroes) are imprisoned or banned
-sometimes inferno heroes (red player) are extreme powerful
-most monsters are savage (diplomacy is still important for surrender,
   later `week of the monster` creatures may join you)
-you have at least eight weeks freedom (reunion normal) to explore your country, 
   if the first computer is entering the teleport system, the war begins
-you should conquer your land fast 
-visit the black tent (your oneway teleporters) as soon as possible, 
   then you can attack your neighbors
-all important things are in the teleport system (artifacts,spells,tents and more)
-in the teleport system, every tent has a guard, one azure dragon (event only for human players)
-if you enter the teleport system, your hero is going off road for a long time 
   and is meeting many enemies - but if he survives, he can become a lot stronger
-to win the game you need at least one superhero (you can reach level 45 and all primary skills 99)
-if you send a hero into the unkwown, there are good chances that he gets killed (be careful),
   this is a XL map, and some very strong enemies may be undiscovered from you for a long time
-money can be a big problem, don´t built units in all cities and save money for surrender
-fulfil as many quests as possible, the quest in your hometown is your main quest
   and gives you a strong boost
-try to complete combo artifacts
-look weekly in your tavern, after a while some good heroes with artifacts may appear
-commanders are the most important units, build up them wisely
-if strong enemies attack your land, use guerrilla tactics (sanctuary), in the beginning they
   are handicapped and do not pass through your border gates
-the player who starts diagonally above or diagonally below from you has the same color tent,
   it´s of strategic significance

five years ago we had played the fine map "vanadia´s rulers" by Stephane Smirnow.
with some major changes it was our favourite map. hundreds multiplayer/single player
games later almost every map area looked differently. after every game, we changed 
the map a lot and added new features. if we found a winning strategy,
then we made it more complex for the human players. we watched the computer play and
arranged the map in a way such that the computer is able to play on full strength
and the typical AI mistakes were avoided. because there are prisons 
(some only for the computer), the battle can last for months. 
even if you are playing our map more than once, you will always find new things,
and every game should be different. we hope it is ok for Stephane that we have
published reunion. this map would never exist without his work!


 
thx : evi for endless playtesting   


have fun !
