Description:	You hate cheaters, especially if it's your brother. You unleash mighty punishment on cheaters. 
Especially if it's your brother.

Special Win:	Acquire Artifact
Special Loss:	Time Limit
Special Other:	Losing the hero Dharmy at the beginning or mid game makes the map unplayable. 
                Do NOT try to take over the enemy's main castle. Instant death will follow.                 Killing the main enemy hero is alright though (even if the text may seem a tad                 ambigious.)
                The spell 'Slow' has been disabled to give you a greater challenge. But if you                 still want it *shrug* go enable it  in the editor (though this will make you a                 cheater and the game easier (but not THAT much easier!) 
                There are no taverns (hence losing Dharmy will make it unplayable).

A small insignificant challenge (which has no relation to the storyline): try and find a hidden Garden of Revelation. It's somewhere in the swamp area. =)
